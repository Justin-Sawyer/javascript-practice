    <h3>FOR LOOP</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <pre><code>

        In English: 
        <pre><code>
            For the array bb above:
            (set 3 conditions:
            1) i = 0; "i" should start at index O;
            2) i is less than bb.length; "i" should only be as long as the array;
            3) i++; "i" should increment by 1 with each iteration.
            )
            {
            If "i" becomes strictly equal to 3,
                {
                    it should stop iterating
                }
            The result should be printed to the console
            }

    <h3>FOR... IN LOOP</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <pre><code>
        for (let i in bb) {
            if (i==3) {
                break;    
            }
            console.log(`i is ${i}: the correct result for for... in loop using "break"`);
        }
        </code></pre>
        
    In English:
        <pre><code>
        For the same array bb above
        For 
        (
        "i" to be the  indices IN the array, as in the first example
        ) 
        {
        {
            If "i" becomes equal to 3, 
            {
                it should stop iterating
            }
        The result should be printed to the console
        }
        </code></pre>

    With this loop, "strictly equal to" will not work as the for... in loop treats the array elements as strings, not numbers.

    In English:
        <pre><code>
        In while loops,because the loop only iterates WHILE the condition is set, we need to declare the variable i:
        Set var i as 0
        While 
        (
        variable "i" is only as long as the length of array bb
        )
            {
