OBJECT ORIENTATED CONCEPTS
They are concepts based on real world objects, rather than of the actions or data.
VERY IMPORTANT for programming - essential, in fact. 
You cannot be a JS developer if you don't understand them.
With functions, you insert the arguments within (), then add the {},
with objects, you state the variable and assign it vales within {}.`)
